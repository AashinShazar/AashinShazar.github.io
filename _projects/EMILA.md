## Project Description
Project EMILA is a cursory investigation into robotic prosthetics. This project essentially gathers EMG data from EMG sensors and has it interpreted by a machine learning classifier to perform a previously mapped gesture. Much of robotic prosthetics technology is still in its infancy and this project was made to learn more about this growing field and where this technology stands today.

## Cost and Equipment
These were some of the major components used in this build:

-   PSOC 5LP ($10)
-   Robot arm kit ($52)
-   MyoWare EMG Sensor ($38)
-   Shaving cream + Razor ($5)
